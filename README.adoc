# DATAMONGO-1229 demo

This is a demonstration of the bug described in DATAMONGO-1229. The repository generator supports
using `IgnoreCase` with a nested field, but actually querying it results in an exception.

## Usage

Launch the application and load link:http://localhost:8080/email/chrylis@gmail.com[]. The queried
object will be returned normally. Load link:http://localhost:8080/emailIgnoreCase/chrylis@gmail.com[],
and the repository will throw an exception.
